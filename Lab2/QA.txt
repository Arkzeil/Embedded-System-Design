5.1 What are the cmake and make for? What is the relationship between them?
	make:智能的批处理工具，它本身并没有编译和链接的功能，通过调用makefile文件中用户指定的命令来进行编译和链接的
	cmake:简单的生成makefile文件给上面那个make用，可以跨平台生成对应平台能用的makefile。根据一个叫CMakeLists.txt文件（学名：组态档）去生成makefile

5.2 Why there are so many arguments in the compilation command(step 4.4.2)? What are they for?
	-I dir
    		Add the directory dir to the list of directories to be searched for header files.  Directories named
    		by -I are searched before the standard system include directories.
	-Wl,option
    		Pass option as an option to the linker.  If option contains commas, it is split into multiple options
    		at the commas.  You can use this syntax to pass an argument to the option.
	-lpthread:
		程式內含有<pthread.h>，編譯需額外加上-lpthread，因為該header在標準linux的import library內沒有，需在編譯時連結
	

5.3 What is libopencv_world.so.3.4.7 for? Why do we need to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./demo to run the 
executable? What would happen if we just run with ./demo? Why?
	
	libopencv_world.so: a shared library that contains all of the OpenCV functions. It is a convenient way to include OpenCV in your project, as you only need to link to a single library
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH: 一個環境變數，讓runtime linker (ld.so)去多找LD_LIBRARY_PATH所指定的路徑。

5.4 It is so complex and difficult to show a picture by using the framebuffer. Why don’t we just use cv::imshow() to do 
this work?

5.5 What is a framebuffer?
	framebuffer是一块内存，里面存放着一帧图像，每帧图像包含每个像素颜色值。BPP，像素深度，指存储每个像素所用的位数。内容对应于屏幕上的界面显示
	Framebuffer就是一段存储空间，其可以位于显存，也可以位于内存。只要是在GPU能够访问的空间范围内(GPU的物理地址空间)，任意分配一段内存(或显存)，都可以作为Framebuffer使用

5.6 What is the result of the command below? Why?
sudo cat /dev/fb0 > fb0
sudo cat fb0 > /dev/fb0

5.7 You can find there is a file named fb1 under /dev directory. What is the difference between /dev/fb0 and /dev/fb1? 
Why we use /dev/fb0 rather than /dev/fb1?
